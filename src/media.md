A selection of media, tastefully curated by hand.

## Podcasts
* [Miley Cyrus on Call Her Daddy](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4aqiLMvHH3ciDLinkwmxTk), I didnâ€™t care much for the host, or the other episode that I tried to listen to of her podcast, but Miley was great on this episode. Love, heartbreak, sex positivity, depending on herself. Worth the listen.
